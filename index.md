About Me 
---

<img align="left" width=150px height=200px style="margin-right: 10px" src="HeadshotSmall.jpg"> My name is Brian Beres and I'm currently an MSBA student at William & Mary set to graduate in May of 2021. Prior to my time at William & Mary, I was a 4 year student at Ohio University. During my time in undergrad, I majored in Business Analytics and Entrepreneurship. Although, my background is in business, I'm interested in careers as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, etc. This github portfolio aims to display the skills I have learned in both programs. If there are any questions regarding this portfolio or my work availability, I can be reached at bberes@email.wm.edu. Thank you and I greatly appreciate you taking the time to look over my portfolio.
