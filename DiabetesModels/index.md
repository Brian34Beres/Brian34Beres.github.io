These are links to work I've done with the diabetes dataset that was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/johndasilva/diabetes. The objective of these files were to test various models and their accuracy rates with the diabetes dataset. In order to obtain the best results possible, I used a great deal of what I learned in my Machine Learning class. This process was very informative and I encourage you to check out my findings below.
